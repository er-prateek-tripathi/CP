the idea behind patterns is that we need to find a relation between all the columns and rows.
if we are able to find the relation betwenn pattern of column to the patterns of columns, 
the formulation of the code will be peice of cake.

Pattern :
* * *

The code provided is a simple C++ program to print a square pattern 
of stars. It works by using two nested while loops: the outer loop 
iterates over the rows of the pattern, and the inner loop iterates over 
the columns of the pattern. For each row, the inner loop prints a star
for each column, followed by a space. After the inner loop finishes, 
the outer loop prints a newline character to move to the next row.


int i = 0; if i is taken 0.
if using i=0, do not use = in while condition.

while ( i<n ) {

}


Pattern : 
1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3

if the row number is 1st then its contents are 1s.

value of nth row = column number of nth row
